* Purpose
I often end up with dozens of windows open and I would like to close all
the shell windows that are not currently running a program with a single
keybinding and have all the window numbers changed to remove gaps.

* Utilities
** screen-kill-shells
   Kills all the screen windows where the title start with "zsh" or
   "bash", except the current window.
** screen-repack
Renumbers screen windows so that there are no gaps.
** screen-windows
   Utility used by the other to retrieve information (numbers and titles)
   about the windows in a screen session.

* Usage
  - bind R exec screen-repack
  - bind K exec screen-kill-shells
